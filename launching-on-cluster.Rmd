This is what I did to launch the different runs on some cluster cores/nodes.

I did it on the cluster, because fishSim takes quite on some conditions.

I will first get a whole node and use all 20 cores, just to see where we are at.

```sh
# get the repo:
cd Documents/git-repos/
git clone git@github.com:eriqande/CKMRpop_vs_fishSim_run_times.git
cd CKMRpop_vs_fishSim_run_times

# get twenty cores and all the memory from them
srun -c 20 --mem=90G --pty /bin/bash
module load R
Rscript --vanilla 001-simulation.R 20 > cores20.out 2> cores20.err

```

And, to do the 003 run, with quickin, I will run it and use 18 cores.
I don't think anything is multithreaded, so that is mostly just
to have the memory.
