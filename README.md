This repository used code for run-timing comparisons between two R
packages, CKMRpop and FishSim, that are presented in the paper “CKMRpop:
Forward-in-time simulation and tabulation of pairwise kin relationships
in age-structured populations” by Eric C. Anderson, which was accepted
on 15-Sept-2021 for publication in *Molecular Ecology Resources*.

R scripts `001-simulation.R` and `003-record-times-using-quickin.R` have
code for the simulations, and the file `launching-on-cluster.Rmd` shows
how I ran those on the cluster. The Rmarkdown docs, with names starting
in `002` and `004` show code for making tables of the results.
